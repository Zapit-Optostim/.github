# Zapit Optostim

This is the home of the Zapit optostimulation project: a scanner-based optostimulator system for head-fixed mouse behavioral tasks.
Zapit is developed at the Sainsbury Wellcome Centre, UCL.

The main repository of interest is [Zapit](https://github.com/Zapit-Optostim/zapit) which hosts the MATLAB code running the scanner calibration GUI, stimulus creation GUI, and the MATLAB API for running experiments.
